## Description:  
OVOS will text one phone number a predifined text when asked.

This skill is used in conjunction with [Waveshare's SIM7600X HAT](https://www.waveshare.com/sim7600a-h-4g-hat.htm). Essentially, when OVOS recognizes an intent, the skill will create a SIM7600X object and call its send message function with a predefined string.
