## Description:  
Search and play music saved to the local file system. By default, the contents of
`/media` will be used, but this can be changed in skill settings. Tagged audio files
will have image art and track info parsed from metadata, but you may also organize
files in the following format to parse untagged files (i.e. `.wav` files).
