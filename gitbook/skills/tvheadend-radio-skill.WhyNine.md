### _tvheadend-radio-skill.WhyNine_  
## Description:  
This skill plays a channel from a TVHeadend server, using the audio profile as defined on the server (this means that the video on TV channels is not streamed or decoded). The user can enter aliases for up to five channels to make it easier to request these channels.

This skill was originally written for Mycroft but has been migrated to OVOS.
