  "description": "This is just a fun skill that should generate a laugh or two and then never be used again.\n\nWhen asked \"who did that\", Mycroft will answer with a statement such as \"it wasn't me. it was the dog\".\n\nWhen told to \"make a farting sound\", Mycroft will play a randomly selected fart sound file, followed by\na statement such as \"did someone sit on a whoopee cushion\".\n\nWhen told to \"let one slip\" or \"fart randomly\", Mycroft will play a fart sound file and make a comment\nat a random interval between 1 minute and half an hour. This will continue until Mycroft is requested\nto stop via \"halt farting\".\n\nThis is a rewrite of (@aussieW) skill-farting so it will work on Mycroft-core 19.8.",
